Introduction
This project deals with the Corporate Medicare Management. This project is very helpful to both Medicare staff as well as to the public. It is having mainly Administration and Client modules. 
The growing quality demand in the hospital sector  makes it necessary to exploit the   whole potential of stored data efficiently, not only the clinical data, in order to improve   diagnoses and treatments, but also on management, in order to minimize costs and improve the care given to the patients. 
	This project adds the details of every individual patient  and the staff appointed to them, it stores the schedule of doctors and their operation timings. It is a user friendly system which can be used  by any person. It can also store the duration of a patient till the time of discharge. It helps in the satisfaction of the user and the public itself.

Existing System Features
1.	Integration of Corporate Medicare centers is very difficult while it is having different branches.
2.	In most of the cases the database is similar from one hospital to another hospital. In those cases also we can’t easily adapt a new technology in the new hospital.
3.	It is very difficult to analyze the usage percentage of  hospital  resources, Bed occupation  Ratio, Administration, Laboratory  information even in a single center. Then we can expect the complexity while integrating  multi-specialty Medicare Centers.
4.	Room Reservations, Doctor Appointment Schedules, Operation Schedules, and Medicine indentation information is very difficult to maintain and share among the different Medicare Centers.
Lack of generic and unique model we have to implement the same set of data model for every newly established Medicare Center.

PROPOSED SYSTEM
In Medicare management situations we are dealing with Data Mining objectives such as:
1.	To optimize bed occupation.
2.	To improve the use of operating theatres, avoiding the cancellation of operations.
3.	To know how emergencies affect to the administration of the hospital departments
 or services (cancellation of operations, etc).
4.	To detect the influence of certain diseases in the hospital’s services.
5.	To find clusters of patients.
